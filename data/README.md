# Data

You can add a README file to explain what the data is, where it is coming from and if the data is not in the repository you could also specify which files are expected to be in this folder

In the example repo we have a text file containing synthetic traces to match with the Fitzhugh-Nagumo neural model. These are presented with the [pre-processing script](../code/pre_processing.py)
